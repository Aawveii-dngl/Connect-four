 logic of comparing with winning array is actually simple and here we simply used a loop and checked the values here winningArrays is all array and winningArrays[1] it indicates first array of it and similarly winningArrays[1][0] indicates the first element of that first array and we have put all possible winning condition and when we click a class is added on each and if the winning pattern contains the class then that person wins
  //   It seems complicated but it is actually very simple
